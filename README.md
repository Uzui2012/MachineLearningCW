## "Sophisticated" Pacman Game Classifier
Built a simple shallow artificial neural network with a single hidden layer that trains on a data set of observations made by pacman that are arbitrary to us with the respective "correct" move that should be followed. 

The following command from within the cw1_pacman folder is to be made to use the ClassifierAgent.

<code>python pacman.py --pacman ClassifierAgent</code>
